quick and merge sort work best for arrays or linked list?

        Quick Sort:

Best for arrays due to efficient index-based access and in-place sorting.
Average complexity: O(n log n), worst-case complexity: O(n^2) (with optimizations, can be O(n log n)).

       Merge Sort:

Best for linked lists due to efficient merging and stability.
Time complexity: O(n log n) consistently, with space complexity being O(1) for linked lists and O(n) for arrays.
